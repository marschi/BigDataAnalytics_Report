\section{Anomaly detection algorithms}
\label{sec:anomaly_detection_intro}

As laid out in the introduction (cf. \ref{sec:use_case1}), we faced the problem of anomaly detection in time series data. In the pursue of solving this problem, we tried out several algorithms of varying complexity, each with their advantages and disadvantages. First, we introduce the Random Cut Forest algorithm in the following section (\ref{sec:rcf_sagemaker}). Subsequently, we put forward a very simple algorithm that we call the Mean Predictor (\ref{mean-predictor}). Finally, we will explain a radically different variant of the Random Cut Forest approach, which incorporates real time data streams into the learning and detection process (\ref{sec:real_time_anomaly_detection}).
